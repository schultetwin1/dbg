# Notes to myself: 

## Where I left off
- Got the debugger working, put up pull request
- Started working on the download path, stuck on figuring out what key to give on command line. I think I should be putting in a path to executable and symbols should be automatically trying to match the debug info

## Next steps
- Read more about different debug symbol file formats
- Chat with Matt about his what his thoughts were on the whole key thing
